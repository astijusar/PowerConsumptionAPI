# PowerConsumptionAPI
This is a an API that is written by Astijus Arimaviƒçius and as one part of a group project for Kaunas University of Technology, [PR00B251 Product Development Project](https://admissions.ktu.edu/programme/b-software-systems/#PR00B251) module.

The product idea is to create a system that collects information about users computer hardware power consumption and sends the data to a server that collects the information. 
Once the information has been collected, it can be viewed by an administrator using a web application which would provide various charts, tables and ways to lower power consumptions.
The administrator can also check electricity prices and obtain additional information.

This API is used to collect the data from the computer applications and to respond requests made by a React website.
